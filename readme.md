# Yelp Backed

## History
We have recently discovered that Yelp wants to move its current stack to a new one based on Java+Spring and ES6+React, they also want to replace its old fashioned Bootstrap UI framework with supercool UI. 

For this herculean task they will hire a whole new team, and selection process is starting now.

### Teams
Here in Propulsion we have presented these three teams. We think that they are compensated in the best way possible. Our goal is that all teams reach almost the same features.

### Stack
* Java8
* Spring Framework
* H2 but if you are into adventures try to implemented with PostgreSQL

## Features
This is a list of features that Yelp would like to see in all prototypes:
* A user should be able to create a new account.
* A user should be able to change its preferences: 
  * First name, last name, email and password.
* A user should be able to log in.
* A user should be able to log out.
* A user should be able to delete his/her account.
* A anonymous or a registered user can access to / where a list of restaurants is going to be presented:
  * An anonymous or a registered user in / can click on a restaurant and its information will be shown.
* An anonymous or a registered user can access to /about 
* An anonymous or a registered user can access to /contact
* An anonymous or a registered user can search for a restaurant by name, and a list will be shown with all the matches.
* A registered user can create a review.
* In a restaurant page a user can edit/delete his/her reviews.

## Planning

We will use GitHub's [milestones]() and [issues]() to track the progress of your project.

On Friday 17th at 14:00 every group will present their projects.

*** If coding from 9:00 to 18:00 (Monday - Friday)  is not enough time to finish, have in mind that the classroom is open 24/7 ðŸ¤“ ***
